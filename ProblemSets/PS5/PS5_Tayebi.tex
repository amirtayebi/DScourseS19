\section{Web Scraping without an API}

As I talk to you earlier this semester, I need to extract all of the censorship events from the Beacon for Freedom of Expression data set. What I did for this homework is not exactly what I want since it just extracts 10 records. I need to create a loop later to export all the data.
I also made use of a tutorial that I found on the net.

\section{Web Scraping with an API}

I had planned to get some data from Twitter, but I didn't know that I needed to make a request. Right now my application is still under review(honestly, an hour ago I made the request!)
What I did for this question is just a simple replication of something that I found on the net. I'll revise my answers once I got the data from Twitter.
