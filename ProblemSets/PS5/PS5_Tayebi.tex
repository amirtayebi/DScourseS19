\section{Web Scraping without an API}

As I talk to you earlier this semester, I need to extract all of the censorship events from the Beacon for Freedom of Expression data set. What I did for this homework is not exactly what I want since it just extracts 10 records. I need to create a loop later to export all the data.
I also made use of a tutorial that I found on the net.

\section{Web Scraping with an API}

I scrapped some data from the votesmart.org website. VoteSmart is a nonprofit organization that gathers detailed data on elections, candidates, politicians, etc.  I need all the biographical data on politicians for my research. What I did for this assignment is just getting some biographical data for two politicians, and all the candidates for two elections.
