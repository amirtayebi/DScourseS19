\section{Research Interests}

 When I was in Iran, I was interested in Macroeconomics and especially, Monetary economics. Basically, almost every graduate student in Iran is interested in macro since faculty member's focus is in macro, and more importantly, micro-level data availability is quite limited in Iran's economy. Besides macro, I have always been interested in politics, and at some point in my undergraduate study, I considered changing my major to politics but since the job market situation in politics is not good, I changed my mind. Having passed one course in microeconometric and two courses in development, I got more interested in development and more specifically, political economy which can satisfy my interests in both economics and politics.

I took this course to improve my ability in programming. Right now I have several ideas, but I need to talk to you about them to make sure the are good enough to be final project.
